## Project Overview 
**Energy Insights 360** is an interactive dashboard for EU fuel statistics, which makes it easy to understand fuel dynamics in the main fuel types (crude oil, coal, lignite, and natural gas) across different regions. This project aims at supporting the EU member states stakeholders by giving them sector-specific information, environmental implications, and visualizations that make it easier to comprehend the usage of energy across industries. Along with that, *Energy Insights 360* stands out from traditional dashboards due to its storytelling feature that allows the users to go through different scales: from global trends down to company and region insights. By starting with global energy consumption statistics, the narrative gives a grasp of the EU's position among other countries which will be followed by an analysis of the oil-producing companies as well as regional differences in using coal, lignite, and natural gas. This is a multi-level strategy that ensures, users not only can see the EU's fuel statistics but also related to how these patterns are located in the broader context of, therefore, they will have knowledge and skills for development and implementation across green and economic fields.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessinng : 

The data preprocessing phase was essential for transforming the original dataset, which consisted of multi-sheet Excel files containing related but distinct fuel statistics. To streamline the analysis process, each sheet was separated, allowing for individual examination and cleaning. This included identifying inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and addressing any missing values to ensure data quality and integrity.
After cleaning, the processed data from each sheet was combined into a single CSV file, with each sheet represented as a separate feature. This conversion not only simplified data handling but also enhanced compatibility with various data analysis tools. By the end of this phase, the dataset was ready for further analysis, enabling the project to effectively derive insights into fuel statistics across the EU and beyond.
